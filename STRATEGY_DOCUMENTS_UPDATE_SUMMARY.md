# Strategy Documents Update Summary

## Date: November 13, 2025

## Overview
Successfully updated all strategy document files in both `/updated_strategy/` and `/public/docs/` directories according to the comprehensive requirements provided.

## Directories Updated
1. `/Users/itziklerner/dev/horizon-website/updated_strategy/` - 9 files
2. `/Users/itziklerner/dev/horizon-website/public/docs/` - 15 files

## Changes Implemented

### 1. SMR Integration Changes ✅
- **Updated SMR capacity spec**: Changed to "3TPD (tons per day) hydrogen production for 2MW power output" throughout all documents
- **Positioned SMR as add-on**: Emphasized SMR is for "areas where hydrogen is not widely available and NG is"
- **Removed detailed technical specs**: Removed specifications like:
  - 100,000+ Nm³/h hydrogen production
  - Operating temperature: 800-900°C reforming temperature
  - Steam-to-carbon ratio details (2.5:1 to 3:1)
  - Overall system efficiency percentages (75-80% with CHP)
- **Key Benefits restructured** into two sections:
  - "In hydrogen rich locations": Leverage hydrogen where available, Easy implementation, Water positive setup, Cost effective
  - "Where H2 is not widely available and SMR is integrated": Leverage existing NG infrastructure, Bridge to pure hydrogen

### 2. Bloom/SOFC Terminology Changes ✅
- **Replaced all "Bloom Energy" references with "SOFC" (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell)**
- **Replaced all "Bloom" references with "SOFC"** where appropriate
- **Maintained analysis content**, only changed naming convention
- Files affected: All markdown files in both directories

### 3. ROI References Removed ✅
- **Changed "ROI calculator" to "cost calculator"** throughout documents
- **Removed links** to `/calculators/roi`
- **Maintained cost analysis content**, just removed ROI-specific terminology

### 4. Deployment Timeline Updated ✅
- **Changed** "Deploy in as low as 4 months" → "Deployment start as low as 4 months"
- **Changed** "deploy in 4 months" → "deployment start as low as 4 months"
- **Changed** "PO to Power-On" → "Deployment start"
- Applied consistently across all documents

### 5. Emissions Messaging ✅
- Emissions reduction percentages (60-70% vs diesel) retained in technical sections
- Messaging focus shifted to primary hydrogen benefits
- "Leverage existing natural gas infrastructure" and "Bridge to pure hydrogen" maintained in key messaging

### 6. Technical Differentiators ✅
- **Added "Power Density" parameter** to technical comparison tables
- **Note added**: "PEM is 1-10 times better than SOFC" for power density
- Updated in: Bloom_Energy_Competitive_Analysis_Updated.md and related comparison tables

### 7. Why Horizon Section Enhanced ✅
- **Added operational cost information**: "At scale, the cost to operate is almost similar to the lower-end cost of the grid, targeting sub 10 cents per kWh"
- Added to:
  - Executive_Strategy_Updated.md
  - Bloom_Energy_Competitive_Analysis_Updated.md
  - Other strategy documents

### 8. EPA Compliance Removed ✅
- **Removed all EPA compliance references** from documents
- Deleted lines containing:
  - "EPA compliant"
  - "EPA compliance"
- Files affected: Executive_Strategy_Updated.md and other key documents

### 9. Containerized Solution Specs Updated ✅
- **Changed from** "100kW" or "200kW to multi-MW"
- **Changed to** "1.5MW continuous power, 3MW peak power"
- **Updated scalability** from "200kW-MW+" to "1.5MW-multi-GW"
- **Removed** all mentions of 100kW containerized systems
- Applied to all solution specification sections

### 10. System Architecture Emphasis ✅
Updated to emphasize:
- Integrated PEM Fuel Cell Hydrogen Power Generator (primary)
- Connected to H2 source
- SMR as optional add-on only where hydrogen not available

### 11. TCO References Standardized ✅
- **Ensured all TCO references show "25-35% lower"**
- Standardized across all documents
- Removed other percentage variations

### 12. Go-to-Market Updates ✅
- **Replaced** "Enterprise data centers with sustainability commitments"
- **With** "Utility providers and local governments"
- Updated in Go-to-Market Strategy sections

### 13. Competitive Analysis Updates ✅
- **Changed** "Modular, scalable systems from 200kW to multi-MW" → "1.5MW to multi-GW"
- **Added Horizon experience**: "with over two decades of experience, and hundreds of MW deployed across various regions such as South Korea, China and Australia"
- **Changed** "250kW Energy Server units" → "325kW Energy Server units"
- **Updated** Horizon Operating Temp to show only "60-80°C" (removed SOFC temp comparison from Horizon row)
- **Updated** SOFC deployment timeline to "12-24 months"
- **Noted** "Fixed 325kW unit size" for SOFC

2. `cleanup_smr_specs.sh` - Detailed SMR specification cleanup

## Notes

- All changes were made systematically using a combination of manual editing for critical files and automated scripts for bulk replacements
- Both source directories (`/updated_strategy/` and `/public/docs/`) contain identical updates
- Changes maintain the analytical and strategic nature of the documents while updating terminology and specifications
- All technical comparisons and competitive analysis remain intact with updated terminology

## Completion Status
