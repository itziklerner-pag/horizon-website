**Horizon Fuel Cell**

Executive Strategy Document

Executive Summary

Horizon Fuel Cell North America delivers zero on-site emission fuel cell
solutions for data centers, eliminating the 18-48 month grid connection
bottleneck. Our purpose-built systems have deployment start as low as 4 months with
99.99% (four nines) uptime and N+1 redundancy, providing reliable, clean
energy for mission-critical infrastructure.

Market Opportunity

Data Center Energy Challenge

The data center industry faces unprecedented growth with AI workloads
driving 40% annual power demand increases. Traditional grid
infrastructure cannot keep pace:

- 18-48 month grid connection delays

- Limited utility capacity in key markets

- Increasing carbon emission requirements

- Diesel backup reliability concerns

Horizon fuel cells provide immediate, scalable power without grid
dependencies, enabling data centers to deploy infrastructure on their
own timeline.

Why Horizon

Purpose-Built for Modern Data Centers

Rapid Time to Market

Pre-engineered systems ship and install with deployment start as low as 4 months. Eliminate
18-48 month grid delays and start generating revenue immediately.

- Plug-and-play design for fast deployment

- Modular scaling to match demand

- Pre-certified and pre-engineered systems

Four Nines Reliability (99.99% Uptime)

99.99% uptime with built-in N+1 redundancy. Proven across 50M+ operating
hours without catastrophic failure.

- Less than 5 minutes downtime per year

- N+1 redundancy architecture

- Hot-swappable components

Zero On-Site Emissions

Pure hydrogen fuel cells produce only electricity and water. Zero
on-site emissions with renewable hydrogen pathway to 100% carbon-free
operations.

- 0g CO₂ on-site emissions

- Silent operation

Lower Total Cost of Ownership

25-35% lower total cost versus diesel+grid. Predictable energy costs
with no peak demand charges. At scale, the cost to operate is almost similar to the lower-end cost of the grid, targeting sub 10 cents per kWh.

- No demand charges

- 20-year lifespan

- Tax incentives available

Solutions Portfolio

Pure Hydrogen Solutions

Our core offering provides clean, reliable power through pure hydrogen
fuel cells:

- Containerized systems: 1.5MW continuous power, 3MW peak power

- Modular scaling from 1.5MW to multi-GW

- Grid-independent baseload and backup power

- Zero on-site emissions

- N+1 redundancy for mission-critical operations

Solutions for Natural Gas

For facilities with existing natural gas infrastructure or those seeking
transition pathways, Horizon offers integrated Steam Methane Reforming
(SMR) solutions that combine on-site hydrogen production with our proven
fuel cell technology.

Integrated SMR-Fuel Cell System

Our SMR integration (3TPD hydrogen production for 2MW power output) provides a complete natural gas-to-electricity
solution for areas where hydrogen is not widely available and natural gas is, with significantly reduced on-site emissions compared to
traditional generators:

**System Architecture:**

- On-site Steam Methane Reformer converts natural gas to high-purity hydrogen

- Integrated fuel cell stack converts hydrogen to electricity

- Optional carbon capture units for further emissions reduction

**Key Benefits - In hydrogen rich locations:**

- Leverage hydrogen where available

- Easy implementation

- Water positive setup

- Cost effective

**Key Benefits - Where H2 is not widely available and SMR is integrated:**

- Leverage existing natural gas infrastructure

- Bridge to pure hydrogen

- No dependence on external hydrogen supply chain

**Deployment timeline:**

- Deployment start as low as 4-6 months

This integrated solution is ideal for data centers in regions with
robust natural gas infrastructure, providing a practical bridge to pure
hydrogen systems while immediately reducing carbon footprint and
ensuring energy independence.
