**Data Center Energy Market**

Research Report 2025

Executive Summary

The data center energy market is experiencing unprecedented
transformation driven by AI workloads, sustainability mandates, and grid
infrastructure constraints. Fuel cell technology offers a compelling
solution pathway, delivering zero on-site emissions, grid independence,
and 4-month deployment timelines versus 18-48 months for traditional
grid connections.

Market Overview

Market Size and Growth

The global data center power market is projected to reach \$45 billion
by 2030, growing at 12% CAGR. Key growth drivers include:

- AI and machine learning workload expansion

- Edge computing proliferation

- 5G network infrastructure buildout

- Hybrid cloud adoption

Critical Challenge: Grid Infrastructure Bottleneck

The primary constraint for data center expansion is not capital
availability but power availability. Traditional grid connection
timelines have become the critical path:

- 18-48 month interconnection queues in major markets

- Limited utility capacity in high-demand regions

- Increasing uncertainty in approval processes

- Rising interconnection costs

This infrastructure gap creates a compelling opportunity for
grid-independent power solutions like fuel cells, which can deploy in as
low as 4 months.

Market Recommendations

Based on market analysis, we recommend the following priorities:

1.  Focus on hyperscale operators facing immediate grid constraints in
    key markets (Northern Virginia, Silicon Valley, Dublin)

2.  Target colocation providers with sustainability commitments and
    expansion plans

3.  Develop edge computing partnerships for distributed deployments

4.  Emphasize 4-month deployment timeline versus 18-48 month grid delays

5.  Position SMR solution as bridge technology for natural gas
    infrastructure markets

Conclusion

The data center energy market presents a compelling opportunity for fuel
cell technology. Grid infrastructure constraints, sustainability
mandates, and AI-driven power density increases create favorable
conditions for Horizon\'s value proposition of zero on-site emissions,
99.99% uptime with N+1 redundancy, and 4-month deployment timelines.
