- Requires natural gas infrastructure

- Site-specific engineering needed

Total Cost of Ownership

While both technologies offer advantages over traditional diesel+grid
approaches, Horizon\'s TCO benefits include:

Horizon Advantages

- No grid interconnection costs

- No peak demand charges

- Lower maintenance costs (simpler technology)

- Faster deployment = earlier revenue generation

- 20-year system lifespan

- Federal and state tax incentives for hydrogen

Bloom Energy Considerations

- Natural gas price volatility exposure

- Potential carbon pricing in future

- Stack replacement costs

- Higher thermal management complexity

Market Positioning

When Horizon is the Best Choice

- Zero on-site emissions requirement (corporate sustainability goals)

- Rapid deployment needed (4 months vs 6-12 months)

- Grid-constrained locations

- Mission-critical operations requiring 99.99% uptime with N+1

- Future-proof technology (hydrogen economy alignment)

- Regions with hydrogen infrastructure or plans

When Bloom May Be Considered

- Existing natural gas infrastructure

- California markets with utility incentives

- Lower initial sustainability requirements

- Existing Bloom relationship

***Note:** Horizon offers SMR-integrated solutions for natural gas
markets, providing a bridge technology with significantly reduced
on-site emissions while maintaining our superior reliability and
deployment advantages.*

Competitive Summary

Horizon Fuel Cell offers decisive advantages for data centers
prioritizing:

- **Zero on-site emissions** - Pure hydrogen produces only water

- **Superior reliability** - 99.99% uptime (four nines) with N+1
  redundancy

- **Rapid deployment** - 4 months vs 6-12 months

- **Technology flexibility** - Pure H2 or SMR integration

- **Future-ready** - Aligned with global hydrogen economy

While Bloom Energy has established presence in the California market
with natural gas solutions, Horizon\'s pure hydrogen approach, faster
deployment, higher reliability, and zero on-site emissions position us
as the preferred choice for data centers committed to sustainability and
operational excellence.
