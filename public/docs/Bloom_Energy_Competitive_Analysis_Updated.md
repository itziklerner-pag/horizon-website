Detailed Comparison

Environmental Performance

**Horizon:**

- Zero on-site emissions with pure hydrogen

- Renewable hydrogen pathway available

- No NOx or particulate emissions

- Silent operation

- Only byproduct: water vapor

**SOFC:**

- CO2 emissions from natural gas combustion

- Lower emissions than grid in some regions

- Exploring hydrogen blend capability

- Limited path to true zero on-site emissions

Reliability and Redundancy

**Horizon:**

- 99.99% (four nines) uptime with N+1 redundancy

- Hot-swappable components

- Fast start-up (minutes)

- 50M+ operating hours proven

- 24/7 remote monitoring

**SOFC:**

- 99.9% (three nines) typical uptime

- Slow start-up due to high temperatures

- Thermal cycling concerns

- Stack replacement required periodically

Deployment and Scalability

**Horizon:**

- Deployment start as low as 4 months

- Containerized systems: 1.5MW continuous power, 3MW peak power

- Modular scaling from 1.5MW to multi-GW

- Pre-certified systems

- Grid-independent operation

**SOFC:**

- 12-24 month deployment timeline

- Fixed 325kW unit size

- Requires natural gas infrastructure

- Site-specific engineering needed

Total Cost of Ownership

While both technologies offer advantages over traditional diesel+grid
approaches, Horizon offers 25-35% lower TCO:

Horizon Advantages

- No grid interconnection costs

- No peak demand charges

- Lower maintenance costs (simpler technology)

- Faster deployment = earlier revenue generation

- 20-year system lifespan

- At scale, the cost to operate is almost similar to the lower-end cost of the grid, targeting sub 10 cents per kWh

- Federal and state tax incentives for hydrogen

SOFC Considerations

- Natural gas price volatility exposure

- Potential carbon pricing in future

- Stack replacement costs

- Higher thermal management complexity

Market Positioning

When Horizon is the Best Choice

- Zero on-site emissions requirement (corporate sustainability goals)

- Rapid deployment needed (deployment start as low as 4 months vs 12-24 months)

- Grid-constrained locations

- Mission-critical operations requiring 99.99% uptime with N+1

- Future-proof technology (hydrogen economy alignment)

- Regions with hydrogen infrastructure or plans

When SOFC May Be Considered

- Existing natural gas infrastructure

- Markets with utility incentives

- Lower initial sustainability requirements

***Note:** Horizon offers SMR-integrated solutions (3TPD hydrogen production for 2MW power output) for areas where hydrogen is not widely available and natural gas is, providing a bridge technology while maintaining our superior reliability and
deployment advantages.*

Competitive Summary

Horizon Fuel Cell offers decisive advantages for utility providers and local governments prioritizing:

- **Zero on-site emissions** - Pure hydrogen produces only water

- **Superior reliability** - 99.99% uptime (four nines) with N+1
  redundancy

- **Rapid deployment** - Deployment start as low as 4 months vs 12-24 months

- **Technology flexibility** - Pure H2 or SMR integration for areas where hydrogen is not widely available

- **Future-ready** - Aligned with global hydrogen economy

- **25-35% lower TCO** - Better economics over system lifetime

SOFC solutions have established presence in some markets
with natural gas solutions. Horizon's pure hydrogen approach, faster
deployment, higher reliability, and zero on-site emissions position us
as the preferred choice for organizations committed to sustainability and
operational excellence.
