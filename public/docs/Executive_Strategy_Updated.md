solutions for data centers, eliminating the 18-48 month grid connection
bottleneck. Our purpose-built systems deploy in as low as 4 months with
99.99% (four nines) uptime and N+1 redundancy, providing reliable, clean
energy for mission-critical infrastructure.

Market Opportunity

Data Center Energy Challenge

The data center industry faces unprecedented growth with AI workloads
driving 40% annual power demand increases. Traditional grid
infrastructure cannot keep pace:

- 18-48 month grid connection delays

- Limited utility capacity in key markets

- Increasing carbon emission requirements

- Diesel backup reliability concerns

Horizon fuel cells provide immediate, scalable power without grid
dependencies, enabling data centers to deploy infrastructure on their
own timeline.

Solutions for Natural Gas

For facilities with existing natural gas infrastructure or those seeking
transition pathways, Horizon offers integrated Steam Methane Reforming
(SMR) solutions that combine on-site hydrogen production with our proven
fuel cell technology.

Integrated SMR-Fuel Cell System

Our SMR integration provides a complete natural gas-to-electricity
solution with significantly reduced on-site emissions compared to
traditional generators:

**System Architecture:**

- On-site Steam Methane Reformer converts natural gas to high-purity
  hydrogen (99.5%+)

- Integrated fuel cell stack converts hydrogen to electricity with
  50-60% electrical efficiency

- Heat recovery systems capture waste heat for reforming process

- Optional carbon capture units for further emissions reduction

**Key Benefits:**

- Leverage existing natural gas infrastructure

- 60-70% reduction in on-site emissions vs diesel generators

- No dependence on external hydrogen supply chain

- Pathway to 100% clean hydrogen through renewable natural gas

- Combined heat and power (CHP) capability for enhanced efficiency

**Technical Specifications:**

- Hydrogen production: 100,000+ Nm³/h capability

- Operating temperature: 800-900°C reforming temperature

- Steam-to-carbon ratio: 2.5:1 to 3:1

- Overall system efficiency: 75-80% (with CHP)

- Deployment timeline: 4-6 months

This integrated solution is ideal for data centers in regions with
robust natural gas infrastructure, providing a practical bridge to pure
hydrogen systems while immediately reducing carbon footprint and
ensuring energy independence.
